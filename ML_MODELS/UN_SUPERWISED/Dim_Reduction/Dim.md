Dimensionality reduction has a 2 types:
      *Feature Selection - select the good feature's   
      *Feature Extraction  - extract the features from a existing one's





PCA
 | Factor                        | Effect on PCA                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Outliers                      | Can dominate variance, misleading PCs             |
| Feature scale                 | It is required, do only they are not in same scale|
| Correlation                   | Determines how much dimensionality can be reduced |
| Number of samples vs features | Less number of rows → unstable PCs                |
| Missing values                | Covariance cannot be computed directly            |
| Noise                         | May appear in low-variance PCs                    |
